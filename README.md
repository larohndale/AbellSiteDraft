This is a read me for the Abell Contracting Website Developed By: Dominque Cox. 

Website Target Completion Date: 11-10-2017

Scrapped the website and started from scratch while maaintaining Brad's approach to the site. The site was built on another platform named SandBox. I have went from scratch and created custom css, javascript, and I have manipulated a few html elements. The goal of the site was to maintain all concepts the site original conveyed while giving it a refreshing modern look. 


 
 <!-- The functionality and better styling of the site will be completed during the second cohert of Code Louisville! -->
