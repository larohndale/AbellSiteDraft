This is a read me for the Abell Contracting Website Developed By: Dominque Cox. 

Website Target Completion Date: 11-10-2017

Scrapped the website and started from scratch while maaintaining Brad's approach to the site. The site was built on another platform named SandBox. I have went from scratch and created custom css, javascript, and I have manipulated a few html elements. The goal of the site was to maintain all concepts the site original conveyed while giving it a refreshing modern look. 

10-03-2017: Made initial document content for webpages on the site.

10-04-2017: Making more adjustments to the content of the page 

10-27-2017: Made a few changes to the website. 
 I intergrated flexbox navs, and bootstrap themes, as well as a jQuery smooth scrool function, and an ajax map for location information. I am trying to implement different aspects of the project requirements using each new page from the navigation bar as a whole new window to experiment with different themes and concepts.
